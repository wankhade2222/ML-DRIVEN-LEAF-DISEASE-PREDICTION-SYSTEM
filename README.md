# ML-DRIVEN-LEAF-DISEASE-PREDICTION-SYSTEM
# ðŸŒ± Plant Disease Detection Using CNN
# This project aims to detect and classify various plant diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset of plant leaf images to identify diseases affecting crops such as tomatoes, corn, and grapes.
